- The word "Ave" isn't read in because instead of <w:t> it uses something
  like <w:t xml:space = "preserve"> which deals with whitespace or something.
- Use switch case to deal with the keywords such as [Date], [Business Name]...
- Make a keywords data structure so you can iterate through them in the switch case
- Make Automatic Date retriever
- Output changes by creating whole new file.
- dayname month day time year
- scrubbing a website seems like more work than it is worth.
- editing the excel table with new jobs applied to would be great.
- For now I will go with manually inputting some data.
- Still need to do zipping and unzipping.
