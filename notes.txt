- The word "Ave" isn't read in because instead of <w:t> it uses something
  like <w:t xml:space = "preserve"> which deals with whitespace or something.
- Use switch case to deal with the keywords such as [Date], [Business Name]...
- Make a keywords data structure so you can iterate through them in the switch case
- Make Automatic Date retriever
- Output changes by creating whole new file.
- dayname month day time year
- scrubbing a website seems like more work than it is worth.
- editing the excel table with new jobs applied to would be great.
- For now I will go with manually inputting some data.
- Still need to do zipping and unzipping.
- Got it working for only for my file.
- The issue is that this algorithm expects each keyword [keyword] to be
  in its own sepeart <w:t>[keyword]</w:t> containers. xml can split words up
  into different <w:t> brackets for a bunch of random reasons so it makes
  editing the docx template trouble some as it might change how the words are
  split up.
- A solution to this might be to simply be to iterate through the input stream
  and gather all the text inside <w:t> objects, no, then I wouldn't be able to
  remake the xml file.
- Another solution could be to open the document.xml file and just manually fix
  and words that aren't set up right. Usually there is just a space between.
  Really I'm not sure how to handle this issue, but for right now I got my
  template set up to work.
- To make the .exe file run outside of code::blocks I added some lines to the
  "other linker options", these were,
  -static
  -static-libgcc
  -static-libstdc++
  -lwinpthread
  Code::Blocks then asked if I wanted to add the compiler flags and I clicked yes.
  Now the first three options don't show up in the other linker options list but
  lwinpthread is still there.
- Look up what it means that a compiler flag was added because I added the -static
  and the others to the "other linker options" list.
